## Purpose

This sample relates to the basic usage of components of the Intel System Debugger.

The folder `system_debug_build` contains both source and documentation for how to use these components.

 These are the following:

`efi_application` : example efi application that can be used to demo the functionality of source level debugging.

`docs` : RST documentation for tutorials of components.

`python` : Python code making use of the component python interfaces (if applicable). These should be run in the Intel® System Debugger Python Environment.


### Docs

`EFIAppliction.rst` : Documentation of how to build and flash the EFI application.

`WinDbgSample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel® Debugger Extension for WinDbg` to debug a real bios.

`TCASample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel® System Debugger` to connect to a real target.

`SysTraceSample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel® System Debugger for System Trace` to work with a precollected trace file.

`SysDbgSample.rst` : Sample of how to use the `Intel® System Debugger for System Debug` to work with the example UEFI application provided to debug bare metal applications.
